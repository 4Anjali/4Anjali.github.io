                    Like most people, I have multiple identities ‚Äî Tech. enthusiast, Robotics and AI nerd, A Third-Culture Kid (An American with India as my country of origin), love fashion and food.
                                        
                    I enjoy researching and building technology systems that help improve the human condition. Specifically, I am fascinated by the super-human abilities of robots and A.I. and the possibility of using them to help solve some of the most wicked challenges facing humanity, as articulated by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

                <p>
                    The two areas that I am currently working on are reducing hunger and improving mental health. 
                    I also am co-founder and CEO of a Detroit based low-profit organization, LIME Lab, through which I have been teaching robotics and programming to K12 kids in the city of Detroit since 2015. 
                    Details and links to my work in these areas are available in the rest of the site.

                <p>
                    For fun, I like to organize and host parties and spend time with family and freinds. I have often been complemented for the cakes I bake!
