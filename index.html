                    Like most people, I have multiple identities ‚Äî Tech. enthusiast, Robotics and AI nerd, A Third-Culture Kid (An American with India as my country of origin), love fashion and food.
                                        
                    I enjoy researching and building technology systems that help improve the human condition. Specifically, I am fascinated by the super-human abilities of robots and A.I., and am excited about collaborating with others on projects that attempt to move us closer to the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The two areas that I am currently working on are reducing hunger and improving mental health. In the future, I am keen on doing projects in other areas like fairness, reducing cruelty towards animals, and reducing crimes agains the climate. More details of my work in these areas is available in rest of the site.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    I am also CEO and Co-founder of a Detroit based low-profit organization, LIME Lab, through which I have been teaching robotics and programming to K12 kids since 2015. While we train everyone, the focus is on girls in an attempt to solve fo the gender gap in technology.

                <p>
                    For fun, I like to organize and host parties and spend time with family and friends. I have often been complemented for the cakes I bake!
