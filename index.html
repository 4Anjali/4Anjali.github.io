                    Like most people, I have multiple identities ‚Äî Tech. enthusiast, Robotics and AI nerd, loves fashion, and
                    co-founder and CEO of a low-profit firm, LIME Lab, that has been teaching technology to K12 kids in Detroit since 2015."
                    
                    I enjoy researching technology as well as building technology systems that can solve problems or create new opporutnities.
                    Specifically, I am fascinated by the super human abilities of robotics and AI and am excited about collaborating with others
                    on projects that attempt to move us closer to the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

                <p>
                    The two areas that I am currently working on are reducing hunger and reducing mental health. Details and links to some of 
                    my research work and projects in these areas are available in the rest of the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For fun, I like to organize and host parties and spend time with family and freinds. I have often been complemented for the cakes I bake!
